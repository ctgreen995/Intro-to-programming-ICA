Requirements

Crysoldier is written in Python 3 and Pygame 2.

Cryosoldier should preferably be run in Pycharm or VScode with Python 3 and Pygame 2 installed. This way it is simple to navigate to the Cryosoldier src directory and run the program.

Cryosoldier can also be run from a terminal provided Python 3 and Pygame are installed on the system and python is added to the path. You can then navigate the Cryosoldier/src directory and run the file you choose with python3 "chosen file.py".

Running

The Past, Present and Future games can be played independently, however running the Cryosoldier program allows all three games to be played consecutively whilst telling the story of Cryosoldier.

NOTE that when running a 2D game from within Cryosoldier, unless the Pygame window is closed by the user, after playing an Era specific 2D game, the Pygame window may remain open however the Cryosoldier game will continue in the terminal.
